# Breath
 A device to prevent deaths due to Asphyxiation, Carbon Monoxide Poisoning and Heat Stroke deaths in Closed Vehicles. 
Presently the prototype can sense temperature and pressure fluctuations and notify the user.

With electric vehicles in action, most of these problems can be solved but in India it might take a decade or two for this electric vehicle takeover. Though these problems can be solved with precaution still many fatalities keep taking place. If we use this device, we can eliminate those and help save many innocent lives.

In Progress:
1. Detect living being presence then sends SOS through Breath app. 
2. take necessary counter actions like windows rolling down, deploying cooling system to increase air flow.
3. Solar Cell integration for eco-friendly power use.

Cost efficient, customisable and easily integrable.
